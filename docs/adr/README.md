## ADR Template

ADRs follow the MADR (Markdown Any Decision Record) format:

1. **Title and Status** - Clear, descriptive title and current status
2. **Context** - Problem statement and background
3. **Decision** - The actual decision made
4. **Consequences** - Positive and negative consequences of the decision
5. **Rationale** - Why this decision was made over alternatives

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** - Initial draft under consideration
2. **Accepted** - Decision has been made and implemented
3. **Deprecated** - Decision replaced by newer approach
4. **Superseded** - Decision replaced by specific ADR reference
