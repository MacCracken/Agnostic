# ADR-002: Multi-Provider LLM Integration Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs to integrate with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, LM Studio) to provide flexibility, cost optimization, and redundancy.

## Decision
Implement a hierarchical LLM provider system with:

1. **Primary Provider** (default: OpenAI GPT-4) for production workloads
2. **Fallback Chain** (Anthropic → Google Gemini → Ollama) for redundancy
3. **Provider-Specific Routing** based on task complexity and requirements
4. **Central Configuration** via `config/models.json` and `config/model_manager.py`

## Rationale
- **Redundancy** prevents service disruption when a provider is unavailable
- **Cost Optimization** allows using cheaper models for appropriate tasks
- **Flexibility** enables easy addition of new providers
- **Task Appropriateness** matches model capabilities to task requirements

## Consequences
- Increased configuration complexity but better operational resilience
- Need to handle different response formats and capabilities across providers
- Requires monitoring of provider performance and costs
- Enables easy switching between providers for testing/optimization

## Implementation
- `config/model_manager.py` handles provider selection and fallback logic
- `config/universal_llm_adapter.py` provides CrewAI compatibility layer
- `config/models.json` defines routing rules and provider configurations
- Agents specify model requirements through environment variables
